# Password Generator Project
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator! This project allows you to generate a random password with the number of letters, symbols, and numbers that you specify.

# Getting Started
To use the PyPassword Generator, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You will also need to have the random module imported in your project.

To start, you will need to set some variables that will be used to generate the password. These variables are:

letters: a list of lowercase and uppercase letters that will be used to generate the password
numbers: a list of numbers that will be used to generate the password
symbols: a list of symbols that will be used to generate the password
Once you have set these variables, you can then ask the user for input on how many letters, symbols, and numbers they would like in their password.

Next, you will create an empty list called password where the randomly selected characters will be added. You will then use for loops to loop through each of the letters, symbols, and numbers variables, and use the random.choice function to select a random character from each list and add it to the password list.

Finally, you will use the random.shuffle function to mix up the characters in the password list, and then convert the list to a string using a for loop. The resulting string will be the generated password.

# Examples
Here is an example of how the PyPassword Generator might be used:


Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password?
3
How many symbols would you like?
2
How many numbers would you like?
1
g9[dD
In this example, the user has specified that they want 3 letters, 2 symbols, and 1 number in their password. The generated password contains 3 letters, 2 symbols, and 1 number, as requested.

# Tips
Here are a few tips for using the PyPassword Generator:

Make sure to set the letters, numbers, and symbols variables to include all the characters that you want to use in your password. You can add or remove characters from these lists as needed.

You can adjust the length of the generated password by changing the number of letters, symbols, and numbers that you ask the user for.

To increase the security of the generated password, you may want to consider using a longer list of characters for the letters, numbers, and symbols variables, and asking the user for a longer password.

I hope you find the PyPassword Generator useful! If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
